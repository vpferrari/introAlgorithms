# introAlgorithms
This repository is an attempt from an amateur to create some basic data structures like lists, trees and some algorithms (whenever is appropriate).

# Basic Data Structures
Data Structures are defined as a particular way to organize data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.*[1] This repository contains some basic data structures, probably common to any Computer Science course.

## Linked Lists
Linked Lists are implemented in linkedLists.h and linkedLists.c and are meant to work as a simple library containing linked lists implementation. At this moment, only single linked lists are implemented, however double linked lists are planned to be implemented in the near future.
